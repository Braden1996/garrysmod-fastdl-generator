Introduction:
=============
Garry's Mod FastDL Generator is a small script created to aid Garry's Mod server management.

Simply put, this will scan a given directory and compress (Using the Source-compatible BZ2) certain files - depending on their size post-compression.

The script will output these size-optimized files into the given directory and will even generate a file containing all the necessary Lua code - [resource.AddFile()](http://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/resource/AddFile). (Just put the file inside of 'lua/autorun/' on your server!).

NOTE: This script has yet to be compiled; so will require a valid installation of [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [PyQt4](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download)!
